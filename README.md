# EP-JS-project
Project for "JS for Enterprise Development" course:
SPA application that will contain modules to show live cryptocurrency pricing data, charts, hottest news and will have a form for subscription on updates.

Library: ReactJS
I will use this library because it's good for rendering some real-time data representations

API: CryptoCompare
It's popular API for getting any kind of data about cryptocurrency that is used in many popular projects.
